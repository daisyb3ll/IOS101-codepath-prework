##future improvements:
**Some ideas to improve the app are:**
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
my favorite apps are: 
1. pinterest 
2. tik tok 
3. instagram 

My top three apps are all social-media platforms, I swear I'm not addicted- I just really like art! Althought all
three of the platforms have most of the same fuctions like some sort of reel/tik tok, social circles/networks, and 
posting, my my favorite features of the apps are (1) the ability to create my own collections of images and videos
( collections in instagram, pinboards in pinterest,  collections in tik tok),(2) I like the built in video and
photo editors instagram and tik tok have and (3), I really like the way pinterest reccomends more content based on
the pinboard collection you create over a feed reccomendaiton as a whole- which is also nice, but its a lot more
helpful when it comes to looking for specific art reference, ideas for hobbies, or guides. 

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app.:
Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. 
You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers
and instructors.

## Notes
Building the app was very simple, the hardest part was creating anf pushing to the github repo
