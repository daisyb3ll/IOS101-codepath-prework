# Prework - * Codepath IOS Prework App; Color Changer*

Submitted by: **Daisy Fernandez-Reyes**

**Codepath IOS Prework** is an app thats main purpose and funcitonality is to familiarize the programmer (me)-  with the X Code environment while developing a IOS applicaiton that displays user name, instituion, and professional role (dream or current role). 

### Time spent: **8** hours spent in total. 

Of the eight hours, 2-3 were spent developing and finalizing the prework application and the rest was 
spent familiarizing myself with the editor- specifically source control. 

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:
- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## Video Walkthrough

Alternaatively, here is a gif demo:

## future improvements:
For future app improvements,I'd like to work towards developing a loading screen on launch, and make it so that the main screen's fonts also
changed with the color. 

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
my favorite apps are: 
1. pinterest 
2. tik tok 
3. instagram 

My top three apps are all social-media platforms, I swear I'm not addicted- I just really like art! Althought all
three of the platforms have most of the same fuctions like some sort of reel/tik tok, social circles/networks, and 
posting, my my favorite features of the apps are (1) the ability to create my own collections of images and videos
( collections in instagram, pinboards in pinterest,  collections in tik tok),(2) I like the built in video and
photo editors instagram and tik tok have and (3), I really like the way pinterest reccomends more content based on
the pinboard collection you create over a feed reccomendaiton as a whole- which is also nice, but its a lot more
helpful when it comes to looking for specific art reference, ideas for hobbies, or guides. 


When it comes to thinking about any apps I'd like to develop, I'd like to develop an app that can help people
start creative hobbies. Similar to what I use social media for now, I think it would be cool to have a space to
create collections of the work and progress people make, it would be fun to have an app that you could put in
what hobby you want to start, and the application reffers you to free online guides, and tutorials. When it comes to
more hands on hobbies, it would be super cool to have an AR function where you can have a little animated person or guide on 
how to do something next to you doing something. So like if I wanted to learn to paint better, I could follow an AR guide and
in the Animation it would be a hand showing you where to paint or how to paint the picture. Like a mini Bob Ross. 
If I was someone wanting to learn to crochet, the guide would show me how to make a pattern. If I was learning to play the guitaur it would
show me where the my fingers would go on the guitaur etc. That would be cool, but I feel its a bit ambitious but it's something 
I'd like ot be able to develop one day!

## Notes
Building the app was very simple - the pre-work guide was super helpful, so I didn't have too many issues with the project itself. 
I did however have issues with the Github repository and learning to commit,push, pull, and fetch with the Xcode source control, but I 
found a nice guide online- hooray! [online x code github guide](https://medium.com/@nkemaiyetin/how-to-create-new-repos-in-xcode-f1f41b98dd09)
